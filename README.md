The present repository contains codes to scrape the European Parliament's website. 

In particular, it allows the user to extract all the speeches from each MEP's personal page, in their original language.

To operate, run the code and then copy the MEP's personal page, specifically "Contributions to Plenary Debates".

I am hopeful this repository will hasten research and civil society investigations on MEP's activity.

Best,
