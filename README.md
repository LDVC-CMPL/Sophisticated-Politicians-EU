The present repository contains codes to scrape the European Parliament's website. 

In particular, it allows the user to extract all the speeches from each MEP's personal page, in their original language.

To operate, first you must install the selenium library for python. Secondly, run the code and then copy the MEP's personal page, specifically "Contributions to Plenary Debates", in the space provided.

Afterwards, the snippet will scrape all the contents and put them in a csv file.


I am hopeful this repository will hasten research and civil society investigations on MEP's activity.

Best,
